# NoSQL Injection Password Export

This asynchronous Python script was made to automate the exploitation of NoSQL injection vulnerabilities within web login forms. It uses a regex payload to guess and build the correct password through HTTP responses.

## Source

This was inspired by exploitation techniques discussed on the HackTricks website:
-  [HackTricks MongoDB NoSQL Injection](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/nosql-injection)

## Requirements

-  Python 3.7 or higher
-  `aiohttp` library

Install the required Python library using pip:

```bash
pip install aiohttp
```

## Usage

Example of usage:

```bash
python exploit.py "10.10.10.10:80" -e "/api/login" -t "Login successful" -u "admin"
```

## Note

This script must only be used ethically.
